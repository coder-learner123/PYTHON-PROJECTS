# Python-Projects
    The first project is a BlackJack game ,played in casinos.
    Rules:
        -->The player can pick cards (hit or stay) until he busts(if total value of all cards is more than 21) or can choose to stay.
        -->If player doesn't bust, it's a dealer's turn then.
                The dealer needs to continuously hit cards until it busts or wins(gets total value of all cards more than player's).
    
    The second project is a Tic-Tac-Toe game , built using Python.
    Rules:
        -->Here,'#' is used instead of cross and '@' is used instead of zero.
